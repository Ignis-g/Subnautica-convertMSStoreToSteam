# Subnautica-convertMSStoreToSteam

This little script try to convert windows store saves (in the wgs folder) to the Steam format for Subnautica and Subnautica: Below Zero.
Not tested for anything else, but it might work too.

The script generates a folder using a timestamp where it outputs the extracted data. What you have to do is to follow the structure above, create the windowsStoreSave folder in the same directory as the script, place the wgs folder inside and launch it.
